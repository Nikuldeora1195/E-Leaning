├── config/         # Database connection (db.js)
├── controllers/    # Logical processing for routes (Auth, Course, Enrollment, etc.)
├── middleware/     # JWT Auth & Role-based validation guards
├── models/         # Mongoose schemas (User, Course, Section, Lesson, etc.)
├── routes/         # Express route definitions
└── server.js       # Entry point

```

### 💻 Frontend (`/src`)

```text

## 🧭 Key Routes

| Entity | Route | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auth** | `/login`, `/register` | Secure onboarding flow |
| **Student** | `/dashboard`, `/my-courses` | Personal learning overview |
| **Teacher** | `/teacher/courses/create` | Course initialization wizard |
| **Content** | `/courses/:courseId/content` | Lesson viewer & management |

## 🔐 Security & Design Decisions

* **Atomic Management:** Course creation is decoupled from content management to allow for a focused, scalable editing experience.
* **Defensive API Design:** Implemented backend validation for `ObjectIds` and unauthorized access attempts to prevent data leakage.
* **State Management:** Secure JWT storage combined with React Context API for persistent user authentication.
* **Scalable UI:** Designed using Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
